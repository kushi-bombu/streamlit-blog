### 🐞 Debugging My First Errors in Python

Coding is fun — until you see your first error message 😵‍💫  
When I began learning Python, I thought everything I typed would work like magic... but Python had other plans for me 😂

### ❌ The Errors I Faced

Here are some of the first errors that made me go "Whyyy daaaa 😩":

#### 1. IndentationError

python
for i in range(5):
print(i)


I forgot to indent the print statement. Python gave me:

IndentationError: expected an indented block


#### 2. SyntaxError

python
print("Hello World!


Forgot the closing quotation. Python scolded me like:

SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal


#### 3. FileNotFoundError

python
with open("myfile.txt") as f:
    data = f.read()


I didn’t even have myfile.txt 😅

### 🛠️ What Helped Me

At first I used to panic. But later I realised:
- *Reading the full error message slowly* actually helps
- StackOverflow and Google became my best friends
- Watching beginner-friendly tutorials showed me how others fixed similar issues

And most importantly — I *stopped rushing* and started reading my code like a teacher 😄

### 🌱 What I Learnt

> Errors are not roadblocks. They are *signboards showing you what to fix*.

Now, whenever I get an error, I smile and think:
> “Yen problemu idu? Let’s solve it, Mustafa style 🔥😎”

It’s not about writing perfect code.  
It’s about improving with each small mistake.  
And maaaan… that feels GOOD! 💪💻
