# 🐞 Debugging My First Errors in Python

Hey everyone! 👋

Today was tough but exciting – I ran into my *first real Python errors* 😅

---

### ❗ The Errors I Faced:
- SyntaxError: missing parentheses in call to 'print'
- NameError: name 'x' is not defined

I was scared at first, but then I started to understand that *errors are part of the learning*!

---

### 💡 What Helped Me:
- Reading the error message slowly
- Searching the error on Google
- Asking ChatGPT (my coding partner 😄)

---

### ✨ What I Learned:
> “Don’t be afraid of errors. They're your guide to learning.”

Next goal: Write code without fear! 💻🔥

Thanks for following my journey ❤️
