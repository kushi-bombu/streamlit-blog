# 🎯 Building My First Mini Project

Hey friends! 🌈

After learning the basics of Python, I finally started building my *first mini project* using *Streamlit* 🚀

---

### 🧩 What I Built:
A simple coding blog website 💻  
Where I can post my beginner-friendly tutorials and updates!

---

### 🔧 Tools Used:
- Python
- Streamlit
- Markdown
- GitHub for storing files

---

### ❤️ My Feeling:
I feel proud of how far I’ve come.  
I used to be scared of coding — now I'm creating projects on my own ✨

This is just the beginning... More learning, more fun ahead! 🌟
