### 🚀 Building My First Mini Project

When I first started learning Python, I always dreamt of building something of my own.  
After learning some basics, I finally gave it a try — my *first mini project*. It was exciting, confusing, and scary at the same time 😅

### 💡 What I Built

I decided to build a *Simple Calculator using Python* that could:
- Add
- Subtract
- Multiply
- Divide

It may sound small, but for me it was a big achievement.  
Here’s a quick sample of what I did:

python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print("Sum:", add(5, 3))

### 🛠️ Tools I Used

- Python (of course 😎)
- VS Code (my favourite editor)
- Basic logic + if-else statements

### 🧠 My Feeling

At first, I was nervous:  
“What if it doesn’t work?”  
But when I saw the output running smoothly... abbaaaa! That feeling was 💯

I realised something important:  
> You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to *start*.

This was my first small step into the world of real coding. More to come... 🌱🔥
